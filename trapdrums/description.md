This one's nuts too. 

At first, set the right knob somewhere in the middle.

Then hold the left two buttons down while twiddling the left knob. Go from one extreme to the other and you'll see it goes through patterns where the kicks and the hats vary. 

Then throw that B button in there and twiddle the left knob. It's similar mechanics to boom bap tweaker, except even more so :)
