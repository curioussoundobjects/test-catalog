# Weclome to Bittyland!

---------------
### V1.02  
Well dear friend, you're one of the first people in the world to be holding a Bitty in your hand and looking at this software.

It works how you would expect - select one of the sound kits on the left and hit the upload button! 

Depending on your machine / operating system it sometimes takes a moment for it to recognize the USB port, so if an upload doesn't work the first time, try hitting the upload button again. 

This software is still in it's early stages, so if you run across any problems feel free to email me at [nick@curioussoundobjects.com](mailto:nick@curioussoundobjects.com)

### HOW TO USE THE BITTY <br>
Press the buttons to trigger sounds (try holding them down) and twist the knobs!

```

<br>
Only a few of the patches today use the function buttons (Sunrise cycles through chord sets, F1 on Looper records, and F1+left knob on Drones & Sprinkles sets the root note for the entire patch). For most of the others it just turns the middle LED on and off.

More than the mechanics, the best advice is to sit with it, explore the extremes of each knob/button and drone out.

<br>
### TREAT IT GENTLY 
Be careful with the USB jack in the bottom and the headphone jack in the top right. They're attached fairly firmly, but without a case, it is possible to torque a cable/jack and rip it off.

<br>
### SPEAKER ON/OFF
The right switch is the main power, and the left switch turns the speaker output off. The headphone jack is always outputting sound.
