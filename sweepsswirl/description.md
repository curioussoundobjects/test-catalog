This one is quite pretty.

The top right button (B) has a lengthy sample made by [Sweeps](https://www.instagram.com/sweepsbeats/?hl=en), whose music is awesome. 

Put the right knob somewhere in the middle. Hold down B and move the left knob around. You'll be sweeping through the in/out points on the sample, making it a simple granular synthesizer.

Best place to start is hold the left two buttons and B with your thumb and play with the knobs.

Check this catalog later for a full Sweeps sound pack too.
