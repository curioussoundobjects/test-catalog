Once a friend and I were doing an art show. His waivy ocean paintings and a few Bitties for people to play with around a table. To set the mood, this guitar chord Bitty was born.

Each button has a 7th chord in it that gets transposed up as you twist the right knob. 

The left knob filters the sound.

Try playing it rhythmically.
