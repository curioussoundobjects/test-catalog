### V1.02  
This one is a pretty melodic one. 

Each button contains a chord (the starting set is a kind of minor C. I, III, IV, VII). As you hold down a button, the right knob cycles through the notes in that chord while holding down the root. 

The left knob changes the speed of the repeat, from quick staccato to longer swells.

The tiny F1 / F2 buttons at the bottom of the Bitty cycle the chord sets (through three sets, one sounds like Transylvania to me, more to come)

#### This sound pack played through a big reverb. Everything sounds good with a lot of reverb :)
