### V1.02  
This synth / sound pack can sound like low drones or twinkly space sprinkles. It's a combination of a filtered square wave and arpeggiation. Check out the video below for a demo of it through an effects pedal.  
<br>

### RIGHT KNOB <br>
The right knob goes from solid drones (all the way left) to quickly arpeggiated twinkles (all the way to the right). Try holding down one of the buttons and moving the knob from one extreme to the other
<br>
<br>

### LEFT KNOB <br>
The left knob is a filter. At one extreme, it opens up the sound, and at the other extreme it "muffles" the sound (rolls off the high frequencies). Moving that knob quickly can produce a kind of wobble wobble that's pretty fun.

### F1 BUTTON + LEFT KNOB <br>
Holding down the left mini button and moving the top left knob transposes all the sounds in the kit up or down. Try moving it almost all the way down until its a low growl.
