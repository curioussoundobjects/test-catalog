This one started out as a dusty quasi realistic drum kit. But then it got tweeeakky.

Hold the left two buttons down (A and C) and twiddle the left knob. That goes through patterns.

But then! Try holding the second button down (B) and twiddle the left knob all the way left and right. What's happening here is that button contains a looping hat, and the knob cuts into that hat as much as you want basically making it automatically loop and play faster and faster.

This is what it can sound like. Bottom half of that video is the Bitty.
